# Wssim

A simple library for simulating Wei√ü Schwarz finishers. The code is still under development, and there is no documentation available at this time. If you want to try this project, please refer to `include/testcase.hpp` for guidance.

# Quick Start

1. Create a new test case function in `./include/testcase.hpp`.
2. Update `main.cc` to call the new function. (The `wssim::basic_bench` function may be helpful.)
3. Build the code and run it.

``` shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./wssim_app
```

4. If you want to plot the results, use the `wssim::basic_bench_json` function. This function will output the results in JSON format. A Python script is provided to load this JSON file and plot the results. (Make sure you have installed matplotlib and numpy.)

``` shell
$ pip install matplotlib numpy
$ python draw.py #in build dir
```
