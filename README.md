# Wssim

A simple library for simulating Wei√ü Schwarz finishers. This repo is still under development, and there is no documentation available at this time. If you want to try this project, please refer to `example/single_sim.cc` for guidance.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new test case function in `example/single_sim.cc`.
2. Update the main function to call the new function. (The `wssim::benchmark` function may be helpful.)
3. Build the code and run it. You will get a `out.json` file including the results.

``` shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
$ example/single_sim
```

4. If you want to plot the results, use the script `python/plot_output.py`. (Make sure you have installed matplotlib and numpy.)

``` shell
$ # pip install matplotlib numpy
$ python ../python/plot_output.py -f ./output.json -t "The title" #in build dir
```
